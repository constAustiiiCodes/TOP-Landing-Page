# TOP-Landing-Page

In this project I will be creating a simple landing page. The main design (completed landing page as well fonts and colors) will be provided by The Odin Project. 

My task is to get my project as close to the finished design as possible. The goal is not to have each pixel in the right place but, rather to create something from scratch and to practice putting together the different front-end lessons that I have gone through so far. 

Let's do this!
